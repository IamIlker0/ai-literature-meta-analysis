arxiv_2304.02924v1,The Governance of Physical Artificial Intelligence,Yingbo Li,Yingbo Li; Anamaria-Beatrice Spulber; Yucong Duan,3,2023-04-06,arxiv,2304.02924v1,cs.AI,cs.AI,237,Physical artificial intelligence can prove to be one of the most important challenges of the artificial intelligence. The governance of physical artificial intelligence would define its responsible intelligent application in the society.,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02924v1,854,2025-08-07T08:16:02.001803
arxiv_2005.10488v1,Does an artificial intelligence perform market manipulation with its own discretion? -- A genetic algorithm learns in an artificial market simulation,Takanobu Mizuta,Takanobu Mizuta,1,2020-05-21,arxiv,2005.10488v1,q-fin.TR,q-fin.TR; q-fin.CP; q-fin.RM,757,"Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence performing market manipulation have been discussed. In this study, I constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention of market manipulation. As a result, the artif...",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10488v1,1904,2025-08-07T08:16:02.001803
arxiv_1509.01213v1,Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Theory,Tshilidzi Marwala,Tshilidzi Marwala,1,2015-07-01,arxiv,1509.01213v1,q-fin.GN,q-fin.GN,289,"Artificial intelligence has impacted many aspects of human life. This paper studies the impact of artificial intelligence on economic theory. In particular we study the impact of artificial intelligence on the theory of bounded rationality, efficient market hypothesis and prospect theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01213v1,3690,2025-08-07T08:16:02.001803
